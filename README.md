### Hi there! I'm Bryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a SWE with a non-traditional path, reach out to me for any questions/advice!

In my free time, I enjoy working out, learning new things, discovering new music, and exploring new places.

<hr>

ðŸŽ¥ I recently started a TikTok account that will feature regular content like:
* Current projects or studies
* Exciting opportunities for non-traditional individuals and new grads
* Daily leetcode
* Interview tips and recommendations
* The occasional (maybe cringy) motivational video

Anyways, feel free to support with a like, comment, or follow! ðŸ˜Š
