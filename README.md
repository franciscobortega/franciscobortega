### Hi there! I'm Bryan

I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University, pursuing a BSE in Computer Science. My interests include full-stack web development and UI/UX design.

I'm currently enrolled in the Software Engineering bootcamp from Hackbright Academy. In my free time, I enjoy working out, learning new things, discovering new music, and exploring new places.
